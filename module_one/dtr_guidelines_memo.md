# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation. 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
	Make the qualities function concise and easily upgradable.  Incorporate array methods in this project to
	get a better understanding.  To acquire as much knowledge as possible.  
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
	Open communication, make sure that both partners understand the code we're implenting.  
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
	Better for us to communicate in person, here on campus.  Any feedback, positive or negative, will help us grow.
* How would you describe your work style?
	Work after school until 8pm. Whenever we encounter problems, seek help. Seek pairing sesssions if needed.  
* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
	Open communication, work together through the entire project.  Make it a point to explain what is happening in the 	    code, explain it line by line, make sure that we own it, that can we can articulate the code we're using during 		evals.
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
	Improve github workflow.
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
	Make decisions together, don't be afraid to make good changes for the greater good of the project.
* How will we overcome obstacles?
	If we have an obstacle, we can pair up. Use pseudo code to help us get through problems.
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
	Being on campus to get work done.  Use monitors.  Find a good relaxing spot free of distractions.
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
	After school would be the best time to work.  Take advantage of class work-time.  
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
	Be open and say it!
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
	Solid handle on css and html, could use improvement on javascript.
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
	Monitors, pairing sessions, github, and when needed, use slack, print out project comp and check off what we finish.
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
	Talk it out, seek help when needed.  
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
	If we can both come out of the project with a solid understanding of the entire process and code, we're succesful.  	    Make sure that we acquire as much knowledge as possible.
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
	Easter candy, high fives.
